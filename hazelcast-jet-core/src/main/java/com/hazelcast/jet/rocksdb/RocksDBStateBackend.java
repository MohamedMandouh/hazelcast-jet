/**
 * Responsible for managing one RocksDB instance, opening, closing and deleting the database.
 * Processors use this class to acquire any number of RocksMaps they require using getMap()
 * Each RocksMap is associated with only one ColumnFamily.
 * There is only one instance of this class associated with each job.
 * The lifecycle for this class:
 * (1) ExecutionContext retrieves an instance of this class from RocksDBRegistry.
 * (2) ExecutionContext invokes initialize() with the directory and serialization service used for this job.
 * (3) Processors acquire the initialized instance from Processor.Context.rocksDBStateBackend() which calls
 * open() to open a new RocksDB instance if it wasn't already created.
 * (4) After job execution is completed, ExecutionContext invokes close() to free the RocksDB instance.
