title: Streaming and Event Time
id: event-time

In an unbounded stream of events, the dimension of time is always there.
To appreciate this, consider a bounded stream: it may represent a
dataset labeled "Wednesday", but the computation itself doesn't have to
know this. Its results will be understood from the outside to be "about
Wednesday". An endless stream, on the other hand, delivers information
about the reality as it is unfolding, in near-real time, and the
computation itself must deal with time explicitly.

## Event Time Vs. Processing Time

Since our reality unfolds in a sequence of *events*, the data in our
stream always represents events. Most importantly, every data item has a
*timestamp* that tells us when the event occurred. All the processing
logic must rely on these timestamps and not whatever the current time
happens to be when running the computation. This brings us to these two
concepts, often discussed when talking about streaming computation:

* **Event time**: determined by the event's timestamp

* **Processing time**: the current time at the moment of processing an
  event

## Time Windowing

With unbounded streams you need a policy that selects bounded chunks
whose aggregate results you are interested in. This is called
*windowing*. You can imagine the window as a time interval laid over the
time axis. A given window contains only the events that belong to that
interval. Probably the most natural kind of window is the *sliding
window*: it slides along the time axis, trailing just behind the current
time.

Sliding window aggregation is a great tool to discover the dynamic
properties of your event stream. Quick example: say your event stream
contains GPS location reports from millions of mobile users. With a few
lines of code you can split the stream into groups by user ID and apply
a sliding window with linear regression to retrieve a smoothened
velocity vector of each user. Applying the same kind of window the
second time will give you acceleration vectors, and so on.

## Event Disorder

In an ideal world, event time and processing time would be the same and
events would be processed immediately. In reality this is almost never
the case, there can be a significant difference between the two. The
difference is also highly variable and is affected by factors like
network congestion, shared resource limitations and many more. This
results in what we call *event disorder*: observing the events out of
their true order of occurrence.

Processing events out of order is a challenge. Hazelcast Jet handles
most of the concerns internally, but there is one decision it can't make
for you: how much to wait for lagging events. Jet can't emit the result
of a windowed aggregation until it has received all the events belonging
to the window, but the longer it waits, the later you'll see the
results. So you must strike a balance and choose how much to wait. This
parameter is called the *allowed event lag*.
