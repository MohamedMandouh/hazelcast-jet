## Requirements

Hazelcast Jet is distributed as a single JAR with no other dependencies. 
It requires Java version 8 or higher to run.

### Install as a Java depedency

The easiest way to get started with Hazelcast Jet is to add it as a
dependency to a Java application. Jet is packaged as just a single Jet
JAR with no other dependencies that contains everything you need to get
started.

Below are the Maven and Gradle snippets you can use:

<!--Maven-->
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-jet</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.2</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
<!--Gradle-->
```
compile 'com.hazelcast.jet:hazelcast-jet:3.2.2'
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

### Write your pipeline

In order to run a Jet job, you must first define a data pipeline which
defines what data will be processed. To create a data pipeline, you need
a data source and a data sink. The easiest way to get started is to use
the provided the test sources within Jet. These sources emit a mock
stream at a fixed rate and can be used for writing test pipelines.

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(TestSources.itemStream(10))
 .withIngestionTimestamps()
 .filter(event -> event.sequence() % 2 == 0)
 .setName("filter out odd numbers")
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

Each test item emitted has a _sequence_ and a _timestamp_. In this case,
we're only interested in the event numbers and we will filter the odd
numbers out.

###Â Create an embedded Jet node, and run the pipeline

Now that we have defined our pipeline, we need to create a Jet node to
submit the pipeline to. An embedded is a fully functional Jet node, running
inside the same JVM and has the same performance as a standalone node.

You can create a single Jet node and submit the job using the following syntax:

```java
JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance();
Job job = jet.newJob(p).join();
```

Note that submitting a job is asnychronous, so we must also call `join()`
afterwards to make sure that we wait for the job to proceed.
