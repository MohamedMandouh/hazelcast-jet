## Requirements

Hazelcast Jet is distributed as a single JAR with no other dependencies. 
It requires Java version 8 or higher to run.

### Install as a Java depedency

The easiest way to get started with Hazelcast Jet is to add is an
dependency to a Java application. Jet is packaged as just a single Jet JAR
with no dependencies that contains everything you need to get started.
