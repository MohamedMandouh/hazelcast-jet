One of the main features of Jet is that it allows you to dynamically
scale a job up or down. Jet keeps processing data without loss even when
a node fails, and you can add more nodes that immediately start sharing
the computation load.

To demonstrate this, submit the pipeline that we have created earlier

## Start a second Jet node

## Terminate one of the nodes
